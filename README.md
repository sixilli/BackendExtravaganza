# docker-laravel-postgres-nginx
Fun way to test out a bunch of backends and work on my docker skills. Currently using postgres in a docker container. Ideally all backend will be dockerized, but currently only Elixir and Golang are running in containers.

### Golang Echo SQL - Done
### Java Spring Boot ORM - Done
### C# ASP.NET Core ORM - Done
### PHP Laravel ORM - Done
### Elixir Phoenix ORM - In Progress
### Ruby Rails ORM - On hold
Rails might have a way around my issues but as things are the naming scheme doesn't line up with what rails wants.
