# Backend Extravaganza
Decided to create a bunch of rest API's in various languages to see if I have a clear favorite. Currently using postgres in a docker container. Ideally all the backends will be dockerized, but currently only Elixir and Golang are running in containers. As things stand currently Golang and Spring Boot are the winners.

### Golang Echo SQL - Done
### Java Spring Boot ORM - Done
### C# ASP.NET Core ORM - Done
### PHP Laravel ORM - Done
### Elixir Phoenix ORM - In Progress
### Ruby Rails ORM - On hold
Rails might have a way around my issues but as things are the naming scheme doesn't line up with what rails wants.
